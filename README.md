# Advance Facial Recognition Employee Attendance System

# INTRODUCTION

Uniqueness or individuality of an individual face is the representation of one’s identity. In this project, face of an individual is used for the purpose of making attendance system automatically. Attendance of the employee is very important for every organization. Conventional methodology of taking attendance is by RFID card system, Fingerprint system, Voice recognition system. But it is easy an employee to manipulate. To stay away from these losses, an automatic process is used in this project which is based on image processing. 
In this project face detection and face recognition is used. Face detection is used to locate the position of face region and face recognition is used for marking the understudy’s attendance.The database of all the employee in the company is stored and when the face of the individual employee matches with one of the faces stored in the database then the attendance is recorded with precise time of entry.



# WHAT IS FACE RECOGNITION ?

Face recognition is a visual pattern recognition problem, where the face, is represented as a three dimensional object that is subject to varying illumination, pose and other factors, needs to be identified based on acquired images. Face recognition is therefore simply the task of identifying an already detected face as a known or unknown face and in more advanced cases telling exactly whose face it is.

# APPROACH

# Local binary patterns histogram 

Local binary pattern (LBP) is a simple yet very efficient texture operator which labels the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel and considers the result as a binary number. 

LBPH algorithm work in 5 steps:-

Parameters: The LBPH uses 4 parameters namely, Radius, Neighbors, Grid X and Grid Y.
Training the algorithm
Applying the LBP operation
Extracting the Histograms
Performing the face recognition

# FEATURES AND DRAWBACKS

FEATURES:-
This system stores the faces that are detected and automatically marks attendance.
Easy to use as it manipulates and recognizes the faces in real time.
Multipurpose software, as it can be used in different places for different purposes.

# DRAWBACK:-

 The accuracy of this system is not 100%. It can only detect face from a limited distance.

 # Result Analysis:-
 We have worked on many different pictures and it has resulted in approximately 70-75% of Accuracy.
